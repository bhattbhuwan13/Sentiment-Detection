# HOW TO RUN
---

From the directory containing README

1. RUN **docker-compose build** followed by **docker-compose up**
2. In your browser, got to http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_sentiment to run the UI
3. For running the api: 
    * **TO GET SENTIMENTS FOR YOUR TEXT**
      Use the 'POST' request for uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict_sentiment, in the body use {"text": "your desired text"} to run the prediction
    * **TO VIEW ALL REQUESTS SENT TO API**
      Use the 'GET' request for uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_all_items: the body should be empty

a repo that contains my deliverables for all the task done during the training
