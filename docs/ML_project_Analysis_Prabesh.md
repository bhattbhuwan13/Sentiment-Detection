# Problem Formulation

## Task
We want a model that can
* Analyze the sentiment from the speech of suspect interviewee 

## Experience
The answers that interviewee gives to the interviewer's question

## Performance
As Measure by 
* Accuracy
* F1 score

## Reason to Solve
The output will be used to
* Keep track of sentiment of suspect interviewee

## Sucess Criteria
Other metrics of intrest are
* Precision
* Recall

# Solution Formulation

Manually, the problem could be solved as
* expert's opinion

It can be formulated as an ML Problem as:
* Classification of the interviewee's answer
* Clustering of the interviewee's answer

A similar ML task is
* NAtural Language Processing

Our assumptions are
* analysing the sentiments of an interviewee can help indentifying the truth behind the case

Our baseline approach could be
* Classification
* Natural Language processing
